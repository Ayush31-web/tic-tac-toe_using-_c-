Hello, This Tic Tac Toe game program employs several functions to handle different aspects of gameplay.
functionOne() is responsible for displaying the current state of the game board after each player's move, ensuring players can see where they and their opponent have marked.
functionTwo() manages player input, prompting them to select a position on the board and validating whether the chosen move is valid (i.e., the position is not already occupied). 
It updates the board accordingly and switches turns between players ('x' and '0').
The functionThree() function checks after each move whether there is a winner by examining rows, columns, and diagonals to see if one player has three of their symbols in a row. 
If all spaces are filled and no winner is found, it declares a tie game. The main() function controls the overall flow of the game, starting by asking for player names and displaying who plays first.
It continues to loop through player turns, calling functionTwo() for input, functionOne() to display the updated board, and functionThree() to check for a win or tie condition until the game ends.
Together, these methods create a structured and interactive gameplay experience for two players.
The main() function in this Tic Tac Toe game initializes player names, starts the game with Player 1 ('x'), and runs a loop to handle player turns and board updates until there's a winner or a tie using earlier mentioned functions.
After the loop ends, it declares the winner or announces a tie based on the game's outcome.
